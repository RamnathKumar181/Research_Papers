# You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

The paper's proposes a novel approach where the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.

## Unified Detection

They unify the separate components of object detection into a single neural network. Their network uses features from the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also predicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an image simultaneously. This means our network reasons globally about the full image and all the objects in the image. The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision. The system divides the input image into an S Ã— S grid. If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores for those boxes. These confidence scores reflect how confident the model is that the box contains an object and also how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts.

## Inference

The grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bounding box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an object falls in to and the network only predicts one box for each object. However, some large objects or objects near the border of multiple cells can be well localized by multiple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to fix these multiple detections.

## Limitations of YOLO

YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that the model can predict. The model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds. Since the model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or configurations. Finally, while we train on a loss function that approximates detection performance, our loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.
